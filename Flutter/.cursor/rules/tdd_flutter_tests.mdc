# 🧪 TDD Standards for Flutter (Unit, Widget, and Integration Tests)

## 🧑‍🔬 Unit Test Standards

- **Rule**: Unit tests must test individual pieces of logic in isolation.
- **How**:
  - Write unit tests for classes and functions to verify the core logic without involving UI or external dependencies (e.g., API calls).
  - Ensure unit tests are **fast** and **independent** from external systems like databases or network calls.
- **Example**:

  ```dart
  // test/auth_manager_test.dart

  /// Tests for the AuthManager class to verify the login logic.
  ///
  /// Use case: Ensure that the login method behaves as expected with valid and invalid credentials.
  test('Login should succeed with valid credentials', () {
    final authManager = AuthManager();
    expect(authManager.login('valid@example.com', 'password'), isTrue);
  });

  test('Login should fail with invalid credentials', () {
    final authManager = AuthManager();
    expect(authManager.login('invalid@example.com', 'wrongpassword'), isFalse);
  });
