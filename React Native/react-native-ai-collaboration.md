# Team Collaboration with AI for React Native Development

## Introduction to Team AI Collaboration for React Native

To ensure consistency, quality, and development velocity in React Native projects, teams using AI tools like Cursor must align around standardized practices. This document proposes a structured framework for integrating AI collaboration into team workflows, promoting reusable knowledge, scalable development, and reliable outcomes.
## Foundation: Standardizing AI Use Across the Team

### 1. Create a Team AI Prompt Library

Establish a shared, organized prompt library to avoid duplication and accelerate development:

```
└── ai-prompts/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── ui-elements.md
    │   ├── animations.md
    │   └── responsive-layouts.md
    ├── state-management/
    │   ├── redux-patterns.md
    │   ├── context-api-implementation.md
    │   └── mobx-usage.md
    ├── testing/
    │   ├── component-tests.md
    │   ├── e2e-tests.md
    │   └── mocking-strategies.md
    └── README.md
```

Each prompt file should include:
- Base prompt template
- Variables to be customized
- Example usage
- Expected output structure

### 2. Define React Native Architecture Prompts

Create standardized prompts that align with your team's architectural decisions:

```markdown
# State Management Implementation Prompt

## Redux Pattern

Create a [feature name] using Redux with:
- Action types defined as constants
- Action creators for [list required actions]
- A reducer with proper state immutability
- Selectors for accessing state
- UI components connected via useSelector/useDispatch
Follow our team pattern with separate actions, reducers, and selectors files.

## Context API Pattern

Implement [feature name] using React Context API with:
- A dedicated context provider component
- Custom hook for accessing context
- State management with useReducer
- Actions for [list required actions] Structure according to our feature-first architecture.
```
### 3. Establish AI Output Standards Document

Create a comprehensive document that defines quality standards for AI-generated code:

```markdown
# AI Output Quality Standards for React Native

## Component Standards
- Use functional components with React Hooks (no class components).
- Components must be strongly typed using TypeScript interfaces or types.
- UI components should follow our design system naming conventions
- Complex components must be broken down into smaller components
- Implement memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) for performance-sensitive components.
- Use getItemLayout where applicable.
- Use named stylesheets, avoid inline styles.
- Adhere to design system components and naming conventions (e.g., PrimaryButton, FormInput).
- Avoid deep prop drilling—use context or hooks instead.
- Ensure proper loading, empty, and error states.
- Include accessibility features:
- Use accessibilityLabel, accessible, and proper roles.
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers and voiceover.

## State Management Standards
# Redux:
- Use reselect for all selectors.
- Reducers must be pure and immutable.
- Action creators must follow {entity}/{action} naming convention.
- Use createSlice if using Redux Toolkit.

# Context API:
- Provide a typed context value and custom hook (e.g., useAuth).
- Separate state and dispatch into different contexts if needed.

# MobX/Zustand:
Follow store segregation by domain.

- Avoid over-reliance on single global stores.
- Side effects (API calls, logging, async ops) must be:
- Isolated in middleware (redux-saga, redux-thunk, useEffect, or custom async hooks).
- Explicit and well-documented.

All stores or contexts must be tested in isolation.

## Testing Requirements
- Every AI-generated file must include a corresponding *.test.tsx or *.spec.ts test.
- Ensure coverage of key interactions (e.g., button clicks, input typing).
- Mock data should follow our fixture patterns
- Use React Testing Library or Detox (for E2E) with realistic user flows.

# Include:
- Tests for loading, success, and error states.
- Boundary and edge case handling (e.g., null, empty values).

# Mocks and fixtures should:
- Follow existing __mocks__ or fixtures/ directory structures.
- Be reusable across test files.

```

## Team Workflow Integration

### 2. AI Integration Workflow

Establish a clear process for integrating AI into the development workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Task] --> B[Check Prompt Library]
    B --> C{Suitable prompt exists?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Adapt Existing Prompt]
    C -->|No| E[Create New Prompt]
    E --> F[Submit for Team Review]
    F --> G[Add to Prompt Library]
    D --> H[Generate Initial Code]
    G --> H

- **Date:** 2023-05-15
- **Prompt Used:** components/lists/product-list.md
- **Modifications Required:**
  - Added pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Enhanced error state handling
  - Fixed image caching issues
- **Time Saved:** Approximately 3 hours
- **Lessons Learned:** Prompt needed more specific platform optimization instructions
```

## Communication Protocols

### 1. AI-Generated Code Labeling

Establish conventions for labeling AI-assisted code:

```jsx
/**
 * AI-ASSISTED: Initial implementation generated with Cursor AI
 * Prompt: components/forms/login-form.md
 * Developer: Alex Chen
 * Date: 2023-05-20
 */
const LoginForm = () => {
  // ...
};
```

### 2. AI Collaboration Channels

Create dedicated communication channels for sharing AI insights:
```
- **#ai-prompt-sharing**: Channel for sharing effective prompts
- **#ai-troubleshooting**: Help with problematic AI responses
- **#ai-techniques**: General discussion about improving AI workflows
```

### 3. AI Review Comments

Standardize how AI-related feedback is communicated in code reviews:

```
[AI-CONSISTENCY] This component structure differs from our standard pattern. 
Please regenerate using the team's component-layout.md prompt.

[AI-OPTIMIZATION] The AI generated code with inline styles. Consider requesting 
a version that uses our StyleSheet patterns.

[AI-QUALITY] The Redux implementation doesn't match our team standards.
Please refer to state-management/redux-patterns.md for the correct approach.
```

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'

jobs:
  ai-quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: ESLint with React Native rules
        run: npm run lint
      - name: TypeScript Check
        run: npm run type-check
      - name: AI-specific linting
        run: |
          npx eslint --config .eslintrc.ai.js ./src
          # Checks for common AI code smells:
          # - Inline styles
          # - Anonymous functions in render
          # - Missing memoization
          # - Performance anti-patterns
```

### 2. AI Code Review Guidelines

- Check that state management follows team patterns
- Ensure feature organization matches project structure

## React Native-Specific Checks
- Look for performance optimizations (memo, useCallback, PureComponent)
- Verify accessibility attributes (accessibilityLabel, etc.)
- Check platform-specific handling (Platform.OS checks)
- Validate responsive layouts for different screen sizes

## Common AI Issues to Watch For
- Overly complex component trees (symptom of poor prompt design)
- Inconsistent state management approaches
- Excessive re-renders due to missing optimization
- Missing error boundaries
- Incomplete platform-specific handling
```

### 3. Regular AI Alignment Sessions

4. Update team standards document if needed (10 min)
5. Set goals for AI process improvements (5 min)
```

## Standardizing React Native-Specific AI Usage

### 1. Component Style Guide Enforcement

Create a Cursor AI configuration that enforces your team's component styling conventions:

```json
{
  "reactNative": {
    "componentStyles": {
      "preferFunctionalComponents": true,
      "enforceStyleSheet": true,
      "noInlineStyles": true,
      "maxComponentComplexity": 200,
      "extractComponentThreshold": 100,
      "namingConventions": {
        "components": "PascalCase",
        "hooks": "useCamelCase",
        "styles": "camelCase",
        "props": "camelCase"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. React Native-Specific AI Templates

Create shared template files for common React Native patterns:

```markdown
# Screen Implementation Template

```
Generate a React Native screen for [feature name] that:

1. Follows our app's standard screen layout:
   - SafeAreaView wrapper
   - Header component with [specific requirements]
   - Content container with [specific layout]
   - Bottom action area [if applicable]

2. Implements state management using our standard [Redux/Context/etc.] pattern:
   - State shape with [specific properties]
   - Actions for [list required user interactions]
   - Loading, error, and success states

3. Follows our design system:
   - Import colors and spacing from our theme
   - Use our Typography components for text
   - Apply standard component spacing

4. Handles these platform differences:
   - iOS: [specific behavior]
   - Android: [specific behavior]

Ensure the code is properly typed with TypeScript and follows our file structure conventions.


### 3. AI Governance Committee

Establish a rotating committee responsible for:

- Reviewing and approving additions to the prompt library
- Updating team standards as React Native evolves
- Addressing AI usage concerns
