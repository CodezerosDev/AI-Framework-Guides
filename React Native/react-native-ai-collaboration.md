# Team Collaboration with AI for React Native Development

## Introduction to Team AI Collaboration for React Native

Ensuring consistent, high-quality output when multiple team members use AI tools like Cursor requires deliberate coordination. This guide presents strategies for standardizing AI usage across your React Native development team to maintain code consistency, quality, and project velocity.

## Setting Up Team AI Standards

### 1. Create a Team AI Prompt Library

Establish a shared repository of effective prompts for common React Native development tasks:

```
└── ai-prompts/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── ui-elements.md
    │   ├── animations.md
    │   └── responsive-layouts.md
    ├── state-management/
    │   ├── redux-patterns.md
    │   ├── context-api-implementation.md
    │   └── mobx-usage.md
    ├── testing/
    │   ├── component-tests.md
    │   ├── e2e-tests.md
    │   └── mocking-strategies.md
    └── README.md
```

Each prompt file should include:
- Base prompt template
- Variables to be customized
- Example usage
- Expected output structure

### 2. Define React Native Architecture Prompts

Create standardized prompts that align with your team's architectural decisions:

```markdown
# State Management Implementation Prompt

## Redux Pattern
```
Create a [feature name] using Redux with:
- Action types defined as constants
- Action creators for [list required actions]
- A reducer with proper state immutability
- Selectors for accessing state
- UI components connected via useSelector/useDispatch
Follow our team pattern with separate actions, reducers, and selectors files.
```

## Context API Pattern
```
Implement [feature name] using React Context API with:
- A dedicated context provider component
- Custom hook for accessing context
- State management with useReducer
- Actions for [list required actions]
Structure according to our feature-first architecture.
```
```

### 3. Establish AI Output Standards Document

Create a comprehensive document that defines quality standards for AI-generated code:

```markdown
# AI Output Quality Standards for React Native

## Component Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- All list components must implement proper optimization (memo, key extractor)
- Components must include proper TypeScript interfaces
- UI components should follow our design system naming conventions
- Complex components must be broken down into smaller components

## State Management Standards
- Redux selectors must use reselect for memoization
- Context implementations must provide custom hooks
- State updates must enforce immutability
- Action creators must follow our naming pattern
- Side effects must be isolated in middleware/effects

## Testing Requirements
- AI-generated components must include test files
- All user interactions must have test coverage
- Mock data should follow our fixture patterns
...
```

## Team Workflow Integration

### 1. AI Review Checklist

Implement a React Native-specific checklist for reviewing AI-generated code:

```markdown
# AI Code Review Checklist

```

### 2. AI Integration Workflow

Establish a clear process for integrating AI into the development workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Task] --> B[Check Prompt Library]
    B --> C{Suitable prompt exists?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Adapt Existing Prompt]
    C -->|No| E[Create New Prompt]
    E --> F[Submit for Team Review]
    F --> G[Add to Prompt Library]
    D --> H[Generate Initial Code]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Manual Review & Refinement]
    I --> J[Apply Team Standards]
    J --> K[Peer Review]
    K --> L[Commit Code]
    L --> M[Document Prompt Usage]
```

### 3. AI Usage Tracking

Implement a system to track AI usage and effectiveness:

```markdown
# AI Usage Log

## Feature: Product List Screen
- **Developer:** Sarah Johnson
- **Date:** 2023-05-15
- **Prompt Used:** components/lists/product-list.md
- **Modifications Required:**
  - Added pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Enhanced error state handling
  - Fixed image caching issues
- **Time Saved:** Approximately 3 hours
- **Lessons Learned:** Prompt needed more specific platform optimization instructions
```

## Communication Protocols

### 1. AI-Generated Code Labeling

Establish conventions for labeling AI-assisted code:

```jsx
/**
 * AI-ASSISTED: Initial implementation generated with Cursor AI
 * Prompt: components/forms/login-form.md
 * Developer: Alex Chen
 * Date: 2023-05-20
 */
const LoginForm = () => {
  // ...
};
```

### 2. AI Collaboration Channels

Create dedicated communication channels for sharing AI insights:

- **#ai-prompt-sharing**: Channel for sharing effective prompts
- **#ai-troubleshooting**: Help with problematic AI responses
- **#ai-techniques**: General discussion about improving AI workflows

### 3. AI Review Comments

Standardize how AI-related feedback is communicated in code reviews:

```
[AI-CONSISTENCY] This component structure differs from our standard pattern. 
Please regenerate using the team's component-layout.md prompt.

[AI-OPTIMIZATION] The AI generated code with inline styles. Consider requesting 
a version that uses our StyleSheet patterns.

[AI-QUALITY] The Redux implementation doesn't match our team standards.
Please refer to state-management/redux-patterns.md for the correct approach.
```

        "props": "camelCase"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. React Native-Specific AI Templates

Create shared template files for common React Native patterns:

```markdown
# Screen Implementation Template

```
Generate a React Native screen for [feature name] that:

1. Follows our app's standard screen layout:
   - SafeAreaView wrapper
   - Header component with [specific requirements]
   - Content container with [specific layout]
   - Bottom action area [if applicable]

2. Implements state management using our standard [Redux/Context/etc.] pattern:
   - State shape with [specific properties]
   - Actions for [list required user interactions]
   - Loading, error, and success states

3. Follows our design system:
   - Import colors and spacing from our theme
   - Use our Typography components for text
   - Apply standard component spacing

4. Handles these platform differences:
   - iOS: [specific behavior]
   - Android: [specific behavior]

Ensure the code is properly typed with TypeScript and follows our file structure conventions.
