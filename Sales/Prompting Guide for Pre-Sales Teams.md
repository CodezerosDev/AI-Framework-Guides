# Prompting Guide for Pre-Sales Teams: How to Effectively Use AI Tools

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide helps pre-sales professionals leverage AI tools effectively by teaching them how to craft clear, contextual, and structured prompts for common sales tasks. Mastering AI prompting will save time, improve client communication, and accelerate tailored proposal creation.

## Understanding AI Prompting

### What is a Prompt?
A prompt is the instruction or question you give to an AI tool. Think of it as giving directions to a highly capable assistant—the clearer your instructions, the better the output.

### Why Prompting Skills Matter
- **Poor prompts** = vague, generic, or irrelevant responses
- **Strong prompts** = accurate, actionable insights and tailored content
- **Result**: More qualified leads, faster proposal turnaround, and stronger client relationships

## The SPARK Framework for Effective Prompts

Remember **SPARK** when crafting your prompts:

**S - Set the Role**: Define who the AI should act as
**P - Purpose**: Clearly state your objective  
**A - Add Context**: Provide relevant background information
**R - Request Format**: Specify how you want the output structured
**K - Key Constraints**: Include tone, length, audience, or other requirements


### Example Using SPARK:
**Instead of**: "Write an email about our software"

**Use SPARK**:
- **S** (Set Role): "Act as a B2B sales professional"
- **P** (Purpose): "Write a follow-up email to re-engage a prospect"
- **A** (Add Context): "The prospect is a mid-size manufacturing company that showed interest in our inventory management software but hasn't responded in 2 weeks"
- **R** (Request Format): "Format as a professional email with subject line"
- **K** (Key Constraints): "Keep it under 150 words, friendly but professional tone"

## Pre-Sales Prompting Templates & Examples

Hi [Name],

Thanks for joining our "AI in Supply Chain" webinar last week. I noticed you asked great questions about implementation timelines in the chat.

I thought you'd find this relevant: ManuTech Corp (similar size to [Company]) reduced their procurement cycle time by 40% within 3 months using our AI forecasting. Happy to share the full case study if helpful.

Quick question: What's your biggest supply chain challenge heading into Q3? Even if AI isn't the right fit now, I'm always interested in industry perspectives.

Best,
[Your name]

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Chain Prompting
Break complex tasks into sequential prompts:

1. **Research Prompt**: "Analyze this company's challenges..."
2. **Solution Prompt**: "Based on the analysis above, create a solution overview..."
3. **Email Prompt**: "Using the solution overview, write an outreach email..."

### Few-Shot Examples
Include examples in your prompts:

```
Write an email following this style:
[Example email 1]
[Example email 2]

Now write a similar email for [new context]...
```

### Persona-Based Prompting
```
You are a seasoned enterprise sales professional with 15 years experience selling to Fortune 500 CTOs. 
Write as if you're having a conversation with a peer, not pitching to them...
```

## Quality Control Checklist

Before using AI-generated content, always verify:

- [ ] **Accuracy**: Does the information align with your product/service?
- [ ] **Relevance**: Is the content appropriate for the prospect/context?
- [ ] **Brand Voice**: Does the tone match your company's communication style?
- [ ] **Compliance**: Does the content meet legal/regulatory requirements?
- [ ] **Personalization**: Are company/contact details correct and current?

## Common Prompting Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- "Write an email" (too vague)
- "Make it sound professional" (subjective)
- "Research this company" (no specific focus)
- Using the first output without review

### ✅ Do This Instead
- "Write a 150-word follow-up email to a prospect who downloaded our ROI calculator"
- "Use a consultative tone appropriate for speaking with VPs of Operations"
- "Research this company's recent acquisitions and expansion plans to identify growth-related pain points"
- Always review, edit, and personalize AI outputs
